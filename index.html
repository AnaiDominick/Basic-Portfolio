                    Hi!! I'm Anai Dominick and welcome to my blog. I am a photography junkie, a popcorn addict, #ifreakinlovetacos, and most recently I'm also a coding apprentice. Mother of two fat cats and married to my partner in crime, we love our escapes to nature. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I have a Bachelor’s Degree in Accounting, a Master in Finance and I’m currently starting a full stack coding program. I’m looking to upgrade my solid academic foundations in accounting and finance, along with my knowledge of functional SAP at a more technical level.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I created this blog to inspire, motivate and help out anyone interested in some Photography and Adobe (Photoshop/Lightroom/Premiere) tips or any coding doubt that you might have, we can learn together. ❤
